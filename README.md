Sorry not sorry, but my AI is quite rebelliousâ€¦ Well that's not true, my work is breathtaking and I leave you flabbergasted. OK fine, my fingers skidded like the skid you are and they're telling the truth! I will not elaborate too much about me, myself and I, because I got many and more important stuff to do than a topic as philosophical asâ€¦

I go by *meangnonne* online, spending my time on the Internet working on my projects when I'm not fulfilling my duties at work or as a housewife. After long hours of <strike>brainstorming</strike> laziness, I decided to create a website to show my wonderful talent to the World Wide Web, and finally reach the full potencial of my greatness.<br>
<br />
In my spare time, I am an artist drawing, painting and creating masterpieces that I proudly arborate at home because I am the best person of the universe and my husband is my only fan.<br>
<br />
To be more serious</b>
I am a Bilingual Technology Specialist based in MontrÃ©al. After a strong experience in Tech Support and different contracts in Cyber Security, IT Management as well as Development, I feel ready enough to embrace all these areas and to perform, in order to build a beautiful career and unifying my skills together. Since I'm still a junior, I have the pleasure of having to prove my worth. Indeed, this is exactly what I'm working on right now.
